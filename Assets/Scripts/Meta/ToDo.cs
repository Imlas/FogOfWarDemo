     * xStart a fresh scene, make a first sample level with probuilder
     * 
     * xMake a singleton tag manager for things to pull from
     * 
     * xBring in the existing player (Dude) objects, drop the FoV/FoW system
     * 
     * xBring in baddieSpawners and baddies
     * Finish making both of them Damageable
     * Finish splitting Baddies into Pathfinder/Attacker/Damageable
     * Add some basic baddie attack animation
     * 
     * Make baddies do damage to player-tagged damageables
     * 
     * Make a basic Cylinder+Sphere topper + cube barrel tower model
     * Make player towers
     * Add a building system - don't forget to adjust pathfinding/target aquisition
     * Need to look into/think about buildable vs non-buildable terrain
     * 
     * Start the player resource system
     * 
     * Add map patches for resources/appropriate buildings
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * 
     * Think about some swarm-like AI behavior, such as grouping up at a "rally" before attacking (similar to factorio bugs)
     * 
     * Way down the list - look into scene templates for making more levels
